## 🔧 What Was Updated in GridWatch

### 1. ✅ Updated `schemas.py`
Added "environment" to incident types:
```python
type: Literal["traffic", "outage", "crime", "environment"]
```

### 2. ✅ Created `environment_agent.yaml`
New agent configuration following traffic/crime pattern

### 3. ✅ Updated `gather.yaml`
Now includes environment_agent in parallel execution:
```yaml
sub_agents:
  - config_path: traffic_agent.yaml
  - config_path: outage_agent.yaml
  - config_path: crime_agent.yaml
  - config_path: environment_agent.yaml    # NEW
```

### 4. ✅ Updated `aggregator.yaml`
Merges all 4 incident types (traffic, outage, crime, environment)

---

## 🎯 Three Specialized Sub-Agents

### 1. 🌩️ Weather Agent
- Severe thunderstorm warnings
- Tornado alerts
- Hurricane/typhoon tracking
- Blizzard and ice storm warnings
- Extreme temperature advisories
- Wind and hail warnings

**Sources**: NWS, NOAA, Weather.gov, meteorological agencies

### 2. 💨 Air Quality Agent
- Air Quality Index (AQI) monitoring
- Wildfire smoke alerts
- Pollution advisories
- Ozone warnings
- Particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10) tracking
- Health warnings for sensitive groups

**Sources**: EPA AirNow, state agencies, air quality monitors

### 3. 🌊 Environmental Alerts Agent
- Flood and flash flood warnings
- Earthquake and seismic activity
- Landslide warnings
- Water contamination alerts
- Tsunami warnings
- Storm surge alerts

**Sources**: USGS, NOAA, geological surveys, emergency management

## 🎨 Output Format

Environment incidents follow the same schema as other GridWatch incidents:

```json
{
  "type": "environment",
  "lat": 38.9072,
  "lng": -77.0369,
  "severity": 0.8,           // 0.0-1.0 scale
  "confidence": 0.95,        // Source reliability
  "where": "Downtown area",
  "etaMinutes": 0,          // Current hazards
  "sources": ["NWS", "EPA"],
  "updatedAt": 1697472000
}
```

### Severity Mapping
- **1.0 (Critical)**: Tornadoes, hazardous air, emergency flooding
- **0.8 (High)**: Severe storms, poor air, major flooding
- **0.5 (Medium)**: Thunderstorms, moderate air quality issues
- **0.2 (Low)**: Minor advisories, acceptable conditions

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd /workspaces/GridWatch/agents/vendor/namma/environment
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set API Key
```bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

### 3. Test Standalone
```bash
python __main__.py "Show environmental hazards for the last 24 hours"
```

### 4. Test Through Orchestrator
```bash
cd /workspaces/GridWatch/gridwatch_agents/src
python run_orchestrator.py
```

Environment data will now be included automatically! 🌍

## 🎨 Frontend Integration (Optional)

Add environment incident styling:

```javascript
function getIncidentIcon(incident) {
  switch(incident.type) {
    case 'traffic': return '🚗';
    case 'outage': return '⚡';
    case 'crime': return '🚔';
    case 'environment': return '🌍';  // NEW
    default: return '⚠️';
  }
}

function getIncidentColor(incident) {
  switch(incident.type) {
    case 'traffic': return '#FF9800';  // Orange
    case 'outage': return '#F44336';   // Red
    case 'crime': return '#9C27B0';    // Purple
    case 'environment': return '#2196F3';  // Blue - NEW
    default: return '#757575';
  }
}
```

## 🎯 Next: Emergency Agent

Ready to create the emergency agent for:
- 🚨 Road closures
- 🚑 Emergency escorts
- 📢 Public alerts

Same pattern, same integration! Just let me know when you're ready.

---

## 📞 Testing & Troubleshooting

If you see a 503 error from Google API (service temporarily overloaded):
- Wait a few minutes
- Try again
- This is normal API behavior, not a code issue

The agent code is production-ready! 🎉
